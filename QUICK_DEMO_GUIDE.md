# 🚀 QUICK START - Engineering Pathway Demo

## ⚡ Fastest Way to Run Demo

```bash
# Terminal 1: Frontend (this is all you need!)
cd client
pnpm dev
```

Open browser: **http://localhost:5173**
Click: **"Engineering & Technology"**
Result: **✅ Works! (Uses mock data)**

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| API not working | Mock data fallback |
| Roadmap disappears | State persistence fixed |
| No debugging info | Comprehensive logging |
| Generic errors | Specific error messages |

## 📊 Expected Console Output

```
=== PATHWAY FETCH START ===
⚠️ Using MOCK DATA for engineering demo
📊 Filtered: 10/10 programs
🎨 Generated 23 nodes and 30 edges
🎬 Starting animation...
```

## ✅ Success Indicators

- [x] Loading spinner appears
- [x] Nodes animate in sequence  
- [x] 4 layers visible:
  - 🟡 Qualifications
  - 🟢 Foundation
  - 🔵 Degrees
  - 🟣 Careers
- [x] **STAYS VISIBLE** ⭐

## 🎪 Demo Features

- **Pan**: Drag background
- **Zoom**: Mouse wheel
- **Hover**: Node highlights
- **Animate**: Replay animation
- **Show All**: Skip to end
- **Back**: Return to menu

## 🐛 If Something Goes Wrong

### Check Console (F12)
Look for:
- ✅ `=== PATHWAY FETCH START ===`
- ✅ `Using MOCK DATA for engineering demo`
- ✅ `Generated X nodes and Y edges`

### Still Not Working?
```bash
# Clear cache and reload
Ctrl + Shift + R (Windows/Linux)
Cmd + Shift + R (Mac)
```

---

## 🎯 Demo Flow

1. **Start**: Click "Engineering & Technology"
2. **Wait**: 2-3 seconds loading
3. **Watch**: Nodes appear one by one (20 seconds)
4. **Interact**: Pan, zoom, hover
5. **Explain**: Show pathway progression
6. **Replay**: Click "Animate" button

---

## 💡 Key Talking Points

1. **"Students with O/L can access pathways"**
   - Show yellow nodes at top

2. **"Foundation programs prepare students"**
   - Show green nodes (NVQ, Certificates)

3. **"Multiple degree options available"**
   - Show blue nodes (7 engineering programs)

4. **"Clear career outcomes"**
   - Show pink nodes at bottom

5. **"Pathways are connected logically"**
   - Show arrows connecting levels

## 📝 Quick Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Blank screen | Check console for errors |
| No animation | Wait 3 seconds, auto-starts |
| Disappears | **FIXED!** Won't happen now |
| No nodes | Check mock data loaded |
