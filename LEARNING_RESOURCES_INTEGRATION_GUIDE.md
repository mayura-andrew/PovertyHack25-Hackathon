# Learning Resources Integration Guide

## üéâ Feature Overview

The **Free Learning Resources** feature is now fully integrated into the application! When teachers view education pathways, they can click on any program node to see AI-generated learning roadmaps with curated YouTube video resources.

## üìã How It Works - User Flow

### Step 1: Select Interest Area
- Teacher selects an area of interest (e.g., "Engineering & Technology")

### Step 2: Select Qualification Level
- Teacher selects the student's current qualification:
  - ‚úÖ O/L Pass
  - ‚ùå O/L Failed  
  - ‚úÖ A/L Pass
  - üîÑ A/L Attempted

### Step 3: View Education Pathway
- System displays personalized pathway showing:
  - Entry qualifications (amber nodes)
  - Foundation programs (green nodes) - **CLICKABLE**
  - Degree programs (blue nodes) - **CLICKABLE**
  - Career outcomes (purple nodes)

### Step 4: Click a Program Node üÜï
- **Look for**: "View Free Learning Resources" text at the bottom of program cards
- **Programs are clickable** - they have:
  - Cursor changes to pointer on hover
  - Slight scale effect on hover
  - Blue text link at the bottom
  
### Step 5: View Learning Roadmap üéì
System generates and displays:
- **Program Overview**: Description, duration, recommended audience
- **Prerequisites**: Required knowledge before starting
- **Key Skills**: What you'll learn
- **Learning Steps**: Structured path with:
  - Step number and title
  - Detailed description
  - Topics covered
  - Duration estimate
  - Difficulty level (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced)
  - **2-4 YouTube Videos** per step with:
    - Thumbnail preview
    - Video title
    - Channel name
    - Duration
    - Direct link to watch

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

#### 1. **CourseNode.tsx** - Program Cards
```tsx
// Added click handling
const isClickable = (data.level === 'beginner' || data.level === 'intermediate' || data.level === 'advanced') && data.onProgramClick

const handleClick = () => {
  if (isClickable && data.onProgramClick) {
    data.onProgramClick(data.title)
  }
}

// Visual indicator
{isClickable && (
  <div className="mt-4 pt-4 border-t border-gray-200">
    <div className="flex items-center justify-center gap-2 text-sm font-medium text-blue-600">
      <BookOpen className="w-4 h-4" />
      <span>View Free Learning Resources</span>
    </div>
  </div>
)}
```

**Changes**:
- ‚úÖ Added click event handler
- ‚úÖ Added hover effects for clickable nodes
- ‚úÖ Added visual indicator for learning resources
- ‚úÖ Only program nodes (beginner/intermediate/advanced) are clickable
- ‚úÖ Requirement and career nodes remain non-clickable

#### 2. **pathwayTransform.ts** - Data Transformation
```tsx
export function transformProgramsToFlow(
  programs: Program[], 
  onProgramClick?: (programName: string) => void // New parameter
): { nodes: Node[], edges: Edge[] }
```

**Changes**:
- ‚úÖ Added optional `onProgramClick` callback parameter
- ‚úÖ Passes callback to prerequisite program nodes
- ‚úÖ Passes callback to degree program nodes
- ‚úÖ Does NOT pass to qualification or career nodes

#### 3. **EducationRoadmap.tsx** - Roadmap View
```tsx
// Pass onProgramSelect to transform function
const { nodes: flowNodes, edges: flowEdges } = transformProgramsToFlow(programs, onProgramSelect)
```

**Changes**:
- ‚úÖ Receives `onProgramSelect` prop from App.tsx
- ‚úÖ Passes it to `transformProgramsToFlow()`
- ‚úÖ Enables program nodes to trigger learning roadmap

#### 4. **App.tsx** - State Management
```tsx
const [currentView, setCurrentView] = useState<AppView>('learning-roadmap') // Added new view
const [selectedProgram, setSelectedProgram] = useState<string | null>(null)

const handleProgramSelect = (programName: string) => {
  setSelectedProgram(programName)
  setCurrentView('learning-roadmap')
}

// New view rendering
{currentView === 'learning-roadmap' && selectedProgram && (
  <LearningRoadmap 
    programName={selectedProgram}
    onBack={handleBackFromLearningRoadmap}
  />
)}
```

**Changes**:
- ‚úÖ Added 'learning-roadmap' view state
- ‚úÖ Added selectedProgram state
- ‚úÖ Added handleProgramSelect handler
- ‚úÖ Added LearningRoadmap component rendering
- ‚úÖ Connected back navigation

## üöÄ Testing the Feature

### 1. Start Backend
```bash
cd pathwayLK
make run
```

### 2. Start Frontend
```bash
cd client
pnpm dev
```

### 3. Test Flow
1. Open browser: `http://localhost:5173`
2. Select "Engineering & Technology"
3. Select "A/L Pass"
4. Wait for pathway to load
5. **Look for programs with "View Free Learning Resources"**
6. Click on a program (e.g., "Bachelor of Software Engineering Honours")
7. See AI-generated learning roadmap with YouTube videos

### Expected Behavior
- ‚úÖ Program nodes should have hover effects
- ‚úÖ Clicking should log: "Program clicked: [Program Name]"
- ‚úÖ View should transition to learning roadmap
- ‚úÖ Loading spinner should show while generating
- ‚úÖ Roadmap should display with steps and videos
- ‚úÖ Back button should return to pathway view

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "View Free Learning Resources" not showing

**Solution**: Check that:
- Node has `level` set to 'beginner', 'intermediate', or 'advanced'
- `onProgramClick` is passed in node data
- CourseNode component received the updated code

### Issue: Clicking does nothing

**Solution**: Check browser console for:
- "Program clicked: [name]" message
- Any JavaScript errors
- Verify `onProgramSelect` is defined in App.tsx

### Issue: Learning roadmap not loading

**Solution**: 
1. Check backend is running: `curl http://localhost:8080/health`
2. Check API keys are set:
   ```bash
   echo $GEMINI_API_KEY
   ```
3. Check backend logs for errors
4. Verify program name is URL-encoded properly

### Issue: No videos showing

**Solution**:
- Verify YouTube API key is configured
- Check API quota in Google Cloud Console
- Check backend logs for YouTube API errors
- Videos may be empty if no matches found

## üí° Tips for Teachers

1. **Best Practice**: Show students the learning roadmap BEFORE they apply to programs
2. **Preparation Time**: Roadmaps show realistic time estimates for preparation
3. **Video Quality**: All videos are filtered for quality (1000+ views, recent, educational)
4. **Step-by-Step**: Encourage students to complete steps in order
5. **Feedback**: Videos are selected by AI but teachers can provide better alternatives

## üéØ Success Metrics

Track these metrics to measure feature success:
- % of teachers who click "View Learning Resources"
- Average time spent on learning roadmap page
- Number of video clicks per session
- Student feedback on video quality
- Improvement in program application readiness

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check backend logs: `docker logs pathwayLK`
3. Review API documentation: `/LEARNING_ROADMAP_FEATURE.md`
4. Test API endpoints directly with curl
5. Verify all environment variables are set
