# Engineering Pathway Bug Fix Summary

## 🐛 Issues Identified

### 1. **Filter was too restrictive**
- The engineering filter excluded prerequisite programs (Advanced Certificate, NVQ)
- This resulted in incomplete pathways being displayed
- Healthcare worked because it had `filter: () => true` (showing all programs)

### 2. **Roadmap disappearing after animation**
- Animation interval wasn't being cleared properly
- No safeguards for empty node arrays
- Missing final fitView after animation completion

### 3. **Missing console logging for debugging**
- Hard to diagnose what data was being fetched and filtered

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### Frontend (Client)

#### 1. Updated `EducationRoadmap.tsx` filters
```typescript
// NOW INCLUDES prerequisites for complete pathways
'engineering-and-technology': {
  institute: 'The Open University of Sri Lanka',
  filter: (name, dept) => {
    const n = name.toLowerCase()
    const d = dept.toLowerCase()
    return (
      n.includes('engineering') || 
      n.includes('mechatronic') ||
      n.includes('certificate') ||  // ✅ Include Advanced Certificate
      n.includes('nvq') ||           // ✅ Include NVQ programs
      n.includes('technician') ||    // ✅ Include ICT Technician
      d.includes('mechanical') ||
      d.includes('electrical') ||
      d.includes('civil') ||
      d.includes('agricultural') ||
      d.includes('textile')
    )
  }
}
```

#### 2. Improved `pathwayTransform.ts`
- Created structured 4-layer pathway visualization:
  - **Layer 1**: Entry Qualifications (O/L, Age requirements)
  - **Layer 2**: Foundation Programs (Advanced Certificate, NVQ)
  - **Layer 3**: Degree Programs (Bachelor's, BSc Honours)
  - **Layer 4**: Career Outcomes
- Better node positioning and spacing
- Color-coded edges for different transitions
- Smart prerequisite detection and linking

#### 3. Enhanced Animation Logic
- Added validation for empty node arrays
- Proper interval cleanup
- Final fitView after animation completes
- Slower animation speed (800ms vs 1000ms) for better UX

#### 4. Added Debug Logging
```javascript
console.log(`Fetching programs for: ${interest}`)
console.log(`Total programs fetched: ${programs.length}`)
console.log(`Filtered programs: ${filteredPrograms.length}`)
console.log('Programs:', filteredPrograms.map(p => p.name))
console.log(`Generated ${flowNodes.length} nodes and ${flowEdges.length} edges`)
```

#### 5. Improved UI Components
- **CourseNode.tsx**: Better gradient colors, clearer borders, improved styling
- **EducationRoadmap header**: Modern gradient header with better description
- Better button styling (Animate/Show All)

### Backend (Go)

#### 1. Added Complete Pathway Endpoint
**File**: `internal/data/neo4j/client.go`
- New method: `GetCompletePathway(ctx, department)`
- Returns all programs in a department sorted by level (NVQ → Certificate → Bachelor)

**File**: `internal/services/pathway/service.go`
- Service layer method for complete pathways

**File**: `internal/api/handlers/pathway_handler.go`
- Handler: `GetCompletePathway`
- Endpoint: `GET /api/v1/pathway/departments/:name/complete`

**File**: `internal/api/routes/routes.go`
- Route already added ✅

#### 2. Client API Integration
**File**: `services/pathwayApi.ts`
```typescript
async getCompletePathway(departmentName: string): Promise<Program[]> {
  const encodedName = encodeURIComponent(departmentName)
  const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/pathway/departments/${encodedName}/complete`)
  const json: ApiResponse<Program[]> = await response.json()
  if (!json.success) throw new Error(json.error)
  return json.data
}
```

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### 1. Start Backend
```bash
cd pathwayLK
make run
# or
go run cmd/server/main.go
```

### 2. Start Frontend
```bash
cd client
pnpm install  # if not already done
pnpm dev
```

### 3. Test Engineering Pathway
1. Open browser to `http://localhost:5173` (or your Vite port)
2. Click on **"Engineering & Technology"**
3. **Expected behavior**:
   - Loading indicator appears
   - Console shows debug logs with program counts
   - Roadmap animates in layers:
     - Layer 1: Qualifications (O/L, Age requirements, NVQ completion)
     - Layer 2: Foundation programs (Advanced Certificate, NVQ Level 3/4)
     - Layer 3: Degree programs (BSc Honours programs)
     - Layer 4: Career outcomes (Software Engineer, Hardware Engineer, Civil Engineer, etc.)
   - Roadmap stays visible after animation
   - Can click "Show All" to skip animation
   - Can click "Animate" to replay

### 4. Verify Other Interests Still Work
- Information Technology ✅
- Construction & Quantity Survey ✅
- Agriculture & Aquatic Resources ✅

## 🔍 Debugging Tips

If the roadmap still doesn't appear:

1. **Check Console Logs**:
   ```
   Fetching programs for: engineering-and-technology
   Institute: The Open University of Sri Lanka
   Total programs fetched: X
   Filtered programs: Y
   Programs: [list of program names]
   Generated Z nodes and W edges
   ```

2. **Check Network Tab**:
   - Look for `GET /api/v1/pathway/institutes/The%20Open%20University%20of%20Sri%20Lanka/programs`
   - Should return 200 status
   - Response should contain programs array

3. **Check Backend Logs**:
   - Should show incoming requests
   - Neo4j queries being executed
   - No errors connecting to database

4. **Verify Neo4j Data**:
   ```cypher
   // In Neo4j Browser
   MATCH (i:Institute {name: 'The Open University of Sri Lanka'})-[:HAS_FACULTY|OFFERS*]->(p:Program)
   RETURN count(p) as program_count
   ```

## 🎨 UI Improvements Made

1. **Gradient Header** - Purple to blue gradient with mission statement
2. **Better Node Styling** - Gradient backgrounds, clear borders, shadows
3. **Color-Coded Pathways**:
   - 🟢 Green: Qualification → Foundation
   - 🔵 Blue: Foundation → Degree
   - 🟣 Purple: Degree → Career
4. **Responsive Animation** - Auto-fits viewport, smooth transitions
5. **Clear Labels** - "🎯 Start Here", "💼 Your Future"
